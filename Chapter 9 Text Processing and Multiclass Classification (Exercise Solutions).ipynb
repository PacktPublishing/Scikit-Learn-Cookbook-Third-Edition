    "## Practical Exercises with Text Processing (Exercise Solutions)\n",
    "In this final section, we will engage in practical exercises involving preprocessing text data, vectorizing it, extracting meaningful features, and building multiclass classification models. These exercises are designed to reinforce the concepts learned throughout the chapter and demonstrate how to effectively apply text processing and classification techniques in various scenarios. By the end of this section, we will have hands-on experience to apply in our own machine learning projects.\n",
